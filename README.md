## Reflection Points

1. **Prop Thrilling**:
    - Create a React application with multiple components.
    - Pass data from a parent component to its child components through props.
    - Demonstrate how data flows from the parent component to the child components.
2. **Use RTK Query**:
    - Set up a Redux store using Redux Toolkit.
    - Use RTK Query to fetch data from a sample API endpoint.
    - Display the fetched data in a React component.
    - Demonstrate the caching behavior of RTK Query.
3. **MongoDB**:
    - Set up a Node.js backend server using Express.js.
    - Connect the backend server to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
    - Define MongoDB schemas and models for the data to be stored.
    - Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for interacting with MongoDB data.
    - Expose API endpoints for interacting with the MongoDB data from a frontend application.
